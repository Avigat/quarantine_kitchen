        <h1>ABOUT THIS WEBSITE</h1>
        <h6>I noticed how many people are getting bored staying at home and doing almost nothing. 
            I created this website so that people can try out new dishes and easy recipes and keep themselves busy when they have nothing to do. 
            This website can inspre people who are new to cooking or people who are tired of making the same things every time. 
            Quarantine gives us great opportunties to learn and do more and more things.
